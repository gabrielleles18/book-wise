This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/),
[chakra-ui](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

* **Prisma** is an open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It is used as an alternative to writing plain SQL, or using another database access tool such as SQL query builders (like knex.js) or ORMs (like TypeORM and Sequelize).

* **SQLite** is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process.

* **Chakra UI** is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

* **TypeScript** is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

This project is a book review website where you can explore books, add a new review to an available book, view the details of a book, and see other reviews made by users.
